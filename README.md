## Description:

This daily planner allows the user to create an hourly schedule from 9.00 AM to 17.00 PM. The time-blocks are colour coded based on the current time of the day, to distinguish between past, present and future tasks. The user is able to save their input by clicking on the save button.

## Lessons learnt:

- Utilised jQuery and Moment.js to create the daily planner
- Used localStorage to store and retrieve the data
- eventListener to store each to-do item when the save button is clicked

## Usage:

Enter tasks into the text field and save by clicking on the save button.
